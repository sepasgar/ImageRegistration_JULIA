# ImageRegistration_JULIA
Image Registration in JULIA language using automatic differentiation
You will find two files in this repository. git_image_registration.jl which is the main code for image registration and transformation.jl (optional) which can make a translated/rotated image based on an original image to feed the main image registration code but you can call your own pair of images to the image registration code also.
The evolution of the corrected image in different levels of the Gaussian pyramid is illustrated below.
