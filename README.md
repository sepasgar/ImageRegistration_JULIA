# ImageRegistration_JULIA
Image Registration in JULIA language using automatic differentiation
You will find two files in this repository. git_image_registration.jl which is the main code for image registration and transformation.jl which can make a translated/rotated image based on an original image to feed the main image registration code but you can call your own pair of images to the image registration code also.
